# Covid-cases-forecasting-and-analysis-using-FB-Prophet
In this forecasting project, I have utilized Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, and the Facebook Prophet library to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data. The code performs data preprocessing, generates insightful visualizations such as choropleth maps and trend plots for global and specific country data, and employs machine learning techniques to forecast COVID-19 cases and deaths. Through a combination of exploratory analysis and predictive modeling, the project offers a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's data trends and potential future trajectories.
